# Hello-Joe
Getting started w/GitHub
There will be code and documents imported in ensuing updates.
Pursuits:
  How to launch code or a file's application from Github or does that occur only if the application is on your machine and
  you initialize a pull request?

  What about video or images in a file?  Will they run, as well?
